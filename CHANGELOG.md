## 0.0.1 - 2024-01-24

## Added
- Initial release version.
- Added extension functions to the AsyncValue class. This includes group2, group3, group4, and group5 methods, which combine 2, 3, 4, and 5 AsyncValue instances respectively into a single AsyncValue.
- Provides convenient functionality for handling results from multiple asynchronous processes simultaneously. This makes it easier to combine and use data from multiple asynchronous data sources within Flutter applications.
- Added unit tests for each extension function. These tests include scenarios for normal cases, loading states, and error cases.

## Fixed
- No fixes in this initial release.
